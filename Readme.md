# IsleRoyale
Ecological Modelling course materials

This is a simple ecological model and supporting materials that simulates the interaction of wolves and moose on Isle Royale. Included is a GUI, programmed with Qt Creator. To run, simply open the IsleRoyale.pro file within the "src" directory and compile with G++, Clang, or MinGW.

A second, stripped, version exists for students. Included in this version are function headers and a minimalist GUI from which to work, as well as thorough documentation.
